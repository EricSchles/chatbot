* we need to generally classify stages of the conversation and then come up with a set of possible responses a person might give - If the conversation gets too far off topic we need to be able to redirect the topic to the type of conversation we are comfortable having

The states of the conversation:

1) greeting - this has been mocked out - we need to get this fully fleshed out.
2) flirting - dropping hints that the girl is under aged, willing and able.  If possible, we should try not to be overt, because this might spoke potiential users of the system.  Unless they are overt first.

For this reason we need to have two types of flirting and we need to be able to detect to two types of flirting:

Overt and submissive flirting

3) Setting up the deal - we need to notice when the deal is being set up and be able to respond appropriately.
